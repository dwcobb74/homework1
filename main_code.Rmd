## Load Libraries

Insert a code chunk to load the `tidyverse`, `unvotes`, and `lubridate` packages.
Use the `knitr` option `include = FALSE`. 

Why can't I get this to work?
{r libs, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## Plot the Data

Choose a country in the data set and replicate what we did in class by 
substituting that country for Australia. Knit the document so that a new
`github-intro.md` file is created, add it to the repo, commit it, and push it
to github. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)

## Data Manipulation
un_votes_joined <- un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States of America", "Mexico")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
  ) %>%
  filter(votes > 5) # only use records where there are more than 5 votes

## Make Plots

p <- ggplot(un_votes_joined,
            aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country))
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ issue) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels = c("Mexico", "U.S.A.")) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  )
```
